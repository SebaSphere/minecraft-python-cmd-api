# Minecraft Python Command API
A work in progress. Run Python scripts stored on the server (or client in singleplayer) in-game, as long as you are an admin and commands are enabled!

Planned features:
[ ] Programs run in their own thread (highest priority feature)
[ ] Minecraft python library for integration into the game
